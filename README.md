## This is a Container in active development by the [LinuxServer.io][linuxserverurl] team and is not recommended for use by the general public.

If you want to comment\contribute on this container , are looking for support on any of our other work , or are curious about us in general, check out the following.

* [forum.linuxserver.io][forumurl]
* [IRC][ircurl] on freenode at `#linuxserver.io`
* [Podcast][podcasturl] covers everything to do with getting the most from your Linux Server plus a focus on all things Docker and containerisation!

## Usage

```
docker create \
  --privileged \
  --name=letsencrypt \
  -v <path to data>:/config \
  -e PGID=<gid> -e PUID=<uid>  \
  -e EMAIL=<email> \
  -e URL=<url> \
  -e SUBDOMAINS=<subdomains> \
  -p 443:443 \
  -e TZ=<timezone> \
  linuxserver/letsencrypt
```

## Parameters

`The parameters are split into two halves, separated by a colon, the left hand side representing the host and the right the container side. 
For example with a port -p external:internal - what this shows is the port mapping from internal to external of the container.
So -p 8080:80 would expose port 80 from inside the container to be accessible from the host's IP on port 8080
http://192.168.x.x:8080 would show you what's running INSIDE the container on port 80.`


* `-p 443` - the port(s)
* `-v /config` - all the config files including the webroot reside here
* `-e URL` - the top url you have control over ("customdomain.com" if you own it, or "customsubdomain.ddnsprovider.com" if dynamic dns)
* `-e SUBDOMAINS` - subdomains you'd like the cert to cover (comma separated, no spaces) ie. `www,ftp,cloud`
* `-e PGID` for GroupID - see below for explanation
* `-e PUID` for UserID - see below for explanation
* `-e TZ` - timezone ie. `America/New_York`  
  
_Optional settings:_
* `-e EMAIL` - your e-mail address for cert registration and notifications
* `-e DHLEVEL` - dhparams bit value (default=2048, can be set to `1024` or `4096`)
* `-p 80` - Port 80 forwarding is optional (cert validation is done through 443)
* `-e ONLY_SUBDOMAINS` - if you wish to get certs only for certain subdomains, but not the main domain (main domain may be hosted on another machine and cannot be validated), set this to `true`

It is based on alpine linux with s6 overlay, for shell access whilst the container is running do `docker exec -it letsencrypt /bin/bash`.
